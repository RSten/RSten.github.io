      <h1>What Did We Find?</h1>
      <p>
        The different datasets used to contruct the features used in this project
        contained a lot of missing data points. Using the ZIP-codes as samples (or observations)
        naturally introduced a sparse dataset as some of the ZIP-codes contains no useful information i.e. Central Park (00083).
        Removal of observations with missing values resulted in a reduction of observations from 262 to 160.
        <br> <br>
        Using a decision tree with only 5 levels of depth yielded an average test accuracy of 47%.
        <br>
        Fitting linear regression models (both multiple and ridge) it was possible to explain an average of 55 %
        of the variance (R^2 coefficient).
        <br> <br>
        Clearly the linear approach to the data was not succesful. The linear models simply does not
        capture the complexity of the data.
        To adress this issue, it would be interesting to implement and train a neural network to predict the diseases.
        Due to the limited time frame of the project we unfortunately haven't been able to do so.
        <br> <br>
        Another way to improve the model would be to add additional features.
        It was disired to include the average Body Mass Index (BMI) as a feature, but other features
        like educational level and crime rate would be interresting to include aswell.
