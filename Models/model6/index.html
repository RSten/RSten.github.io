      <h1>What Did We Find?</h1>
      <p>
        The different data set used to contruct the features used in this project
        contained a lot of missing data points. Using the ZIP-codes as samples (or observations)
        already composed a sparse data set. The missing values only contributes to worsening this
        problem.
        <br> <br>
        Using a decision tree with only 5 levels of depth it was possible to gain an average test
        accuracy of 47%.

        Using linear regression (both multiple and ridge) it was possible to explain an average of 55 %
        of the variance (R^2 coefficient).
        <br> <br>
        Clearly the linear approach to the data was not succesful. The linear models simply does not
        capture the complexity of the data.
        <br>
        To adress this issue, it would be interesting to implement and train a neural network to predict the diseases.
        Due to the limited time frame of the project we unfortunately haven't been able to do so.
        <br> <br>
        It was disired to include the average Body Mass Index (BMI) as a feature, but other features
        like educational level and crime rate would be interresting aswell.
