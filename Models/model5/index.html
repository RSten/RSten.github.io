      <h1>Can We Find A Linear Relationship?</h1>
      <p>
        Based on the scatter plot (shown to the right) and the interactive map shown on a previous slide,
        we thought that it might be possible to predict the number of heart failures in a zip code based on the other features.
        Using linear regression to predict the number of heart failures within each zip-code, the following results was obtained.
        <br>
        Traning variance score = 0.33
        <br>
        Test variance score = 0.34
        <br>
        <br>
        In order to improve the prediction, ridge regression was implemented. By optimizing the regularization term the following results were obtained:
        <br>
        Traning variance score = 0.28
        <br>
        Test variance score = 0.55
        <br>
