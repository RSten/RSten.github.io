      <h1>Can We Find A Linear Relationship?</h1>
      <p>
        After initial exploration of the dataset, it was assumed that a linear relationship excisted between economic status
        and the number of heart failures.
        To further explore this idea two diffent linear models were fitted to data. The task was to predict the number of
        heart failures based on the 7 economic features along with the number of fast food restaurants.
        <br><br>
        This relation would prove once and for all, that it is better to be rich and healthy than poor and sick!
        <br><br>
        Using multiple linear regression to predict the number of heart failures within each zip-code, the following results were obtained.
        <br>
        Traning variance score = 0.33
        <br>
        Test variance score = 0.34
        <br>
        <br>
        In order to improve the prediction, ridge regression was implemented. By optimizing the regularization term the following results were obtained:
        <br>
        Traning variance score = 0.28
        <br>
        Test variance score = 0.55
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately the results indicates that the relationship between heart failure and economy
        is too complex to be described by a linear model.
